It’s been long time since I wrote my last post about Meta programming; I did not find time as I was busy, finally I spared some time from my hectic schedule to upgrade my old plugins to rails 3.  

Much was said about Rails 3 and extending it. Till now maybe you have figured out that I am talking about Railtie. But I did not need that for upgrading my plugin to rails 3.  

So finally I worked on them and pushed the upgraded version to GitHub. So check them out here  

[Flash Player Helper for Rails 3.x](https://github.com/bagwanpankaj/flash_player_helper) and  
[Rails 2.x and  SilverLight Player Helper for Rails 3.x and Rails 2.x](https://github.com/bagwanpankaj/flash_player_helper)  

Have a happy boarding.
