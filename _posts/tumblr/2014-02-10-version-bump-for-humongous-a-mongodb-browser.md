Its been very long since I have updated [humongous](http://github.com/bagwanpankaj/humongous). I had long list of issues to work upon. Finally I had some time to look back to it and other open source projects. 

I fixed some issues, discarded some. One big issue that has been fixed in this was `explicit login` for user to log in into remote MongoDb instances.
