I was working on project when I bumped into a new feature, rather an old one; I donâ€™t care although, that we can render partial without writing partial or locals.  Check it out how?  
before   

{% highlight ruby %}
render :partial => ''students/notice_board'', :locals => { :note =>@ note, :show_title => true}    
{% endhighlight %}

this can be rewritten as:   

{% highlight ruby %}
render ''students/notice_board'', :note => @note, :show_title => true    
{% endhighlight %}

and all those thing will be working as is as before.  Pamper your hands, try this.

Three cheers.
