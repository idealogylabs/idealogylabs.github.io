Though that tactical shift was forced because of several factors (as listed)

- Increased Infrastructure cost
- To avoid vendor lock-in
- To avoid properitery cost
- Increased labor cost for properitery softwares

We are going to stress on vendor lock-in. Cost and properitery matters but matters/hurts less than
locking for a particular vendor. Migrating to other vendors would prove costly as well as a tedious and time
consuming.

With cloud technologies booming in recent years it has proven to avoid vendor lock-ins if used efficiently
Here at IdealogyLabs, we use weigh multiple approaches and solution for our customer to avoid/lessen any specific 
vendor lock-ins
