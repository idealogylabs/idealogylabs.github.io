In last [part](/blog/golang/2014/03/15/go-to-go-concurrency.html), we talked about `goroutines` and channels. As discussed there is much more to channels, liked channel direction, by default a channel is bi-directional, but it can be restricted to sending or receiving.

In sender, receiver example from [part](/blog/golang/2014/03/15/go-to-go-concurrency.html), sender can only be restricted to sending, by redifining it like

{% highlight go %}
func sender(ch chan <- int) {
  for i := 0; ; i++ {
    ch <- i
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now sender can only send signal to channel `ch`. Similarly receiver can be restricted just to receive, by redifining it like

{% highlight go %}
func receiver(ch <- chan int) {
  for {
    message := <- ch
    fmt.Println("received: ", message)
    time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

###### Buffering in channels

Generally `channels` are synchronous, but they can have buffer of specified size. Buffer size can be specified by passing a second argument while creating a channel

{% highlight go %}
ch := make(chan int, 10)
{% endhighlight %}

Now this channel can buffer at most 10 messages, working as a pub/sub.

###### Select

Select work like a case switch for channels, basic construct looks like:

{% highlight go %}
select {
case message_from_ch1 := <- ch1:
    fmt.Println(message_from_ch1)
case message_from_ch2 := <- ch2:
    fmt.Println(message_from_ch2)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Happy Channeling :)
