Today we are excited to announce the inception of "Idealogy Labs". We are bunch of technology enthusiast, having rigorous experience in several technology domains from CMS, to ERP, to medical, to risk management and list does not stop here.

We excels in cutting edge technologies, ruby, rails, python, django, node.js, hadoop, hive and go. We love working on challanges on technology frontier, we love open source and contribute back to it.

But, one would be asking how we defer from shops out there, here are some FAQ's

**How we differ from other tech. shops out there?**

* We are bunch of technology enthusiast, who love working with technologies, we dont just take it as 9 to 5 job. 
* We indulge in product development, not just implement. 
* We know technologies inside out, not just for work.
* We follow best industry practices (Scrum, Continuous Integration, TDD)
* We believe in team extension, not offshoring
* We create values for customer, not just deliver product.
* We deliver what/when we promised.

**What Technologies we excel in?**

Though we are not bound by technologies, as wel love to be up to date with modern world where technologies are just tools to achieve something. But if one insist, we do excel in following tools and technologies (but not limited to):

* Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Sinatra, Padrino, Capistrano etc..
* Python, Django, Flask etc..
* Go, revel, goji, beego etc..
* JavaScript, Node.JS, Express.JS, Gulp, Grunt etc...
* R
* MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis etc..
* Amazon, RackSpace, DigitalOcean etc..
* Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Casandra, Spark


**What development process do we follow?**

We are on the top of industrial best practices and keep ourselves up-to-date. Here are some methodologies, frameworks, processes and tools we use in day-today life

* We Scrum (XP, Pair Programming and Kanban or Scrumban)
* We follow TDD/BDD (Test Driven Development/Behaviour Driven Development) religiously
* We do Continuous Integration and Continuous Development

* We do deliver MVP/usable product in every iteration/sprint
* We promise to deliver MVP within first 45 days.

**What about Start Ups?**

We worked in startups, we are well known of fast-paced culture, strict delivery deadline/funding they follow. We, ourselves are startup. We are open to work as a partner or extended team.

**What about scarcity of right talent?**

Though we have up-to-date industry professionals working on cutting edge technologies, but even if we do not have one, we are able to provide you one, meetting quality expectations, within given timeframe promising retention at the sametime.
