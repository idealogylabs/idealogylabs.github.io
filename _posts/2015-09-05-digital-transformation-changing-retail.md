Technology domain is changing rapidly but companies and retailers not adpting with same pace. 
For over long time there have many disruption because of retailers failing to adapt.

Traditionaly retailers used to have control on everything they sale. But that scenario is changing 
more recently because of technologies, there has been disruptive changes on retail front. Rise of 
Internet services and social media powered buyer to directly contact with brands, know competitive 
pricing etc. Retailers/brands opted for direct selling passing broker's pie to end users' buyers, 
making it win-win situation. 

Rise of big-data and data analytics more streamlined the selling powering seller to customise selling,
gauging interest of buyers and offering accordingly to increase market and profit share.

Digital Transformation in retail enabling retailer to become omnipresent, though still there are some gaps
needs to be filled to actually make digital market as omnipresent, one of them being access to the internet 
and to the market.

Retail is evolving so quickly today that success is a perpetually moving target. Retailers need the ability to 
pivot quickly and in multiple directions to meet or exceed the always changing expectations of the modern 
consumer.

As traditional retailers increasing there digital presence, absence of data is still proving a major hurdle.
Most retailer still fails to record data of consumer behavior and shopping trends, making them fail to improve
customer experience. This becomes a challange and a source of huge, untapped potential for established brands 
with significant physical footprints.

Technologies evolution have already reached a point where it can easily fill this spot for customer retail 
interactions. As Big data, cloud and analytics allows forward thinking retailers to avail benefits of 
huge data already available and continue to be available, enabling them to march forward to ultimate goal of 
being truly omnichannel and personalise consumer experience.

By using technologies to personalize shopping experience, enables them to recognise consumer and their 
previous shopping trends and provide them convenient and personalised experience. Benefit can be many fold 
when more and more retailers start sharing their data with each other to improve customer satisfaction. Retailers 
could augment their newly enhanced consumer data with additional third-party information, such as demographic 
trends, geographic location, etc. The potential is enormous, not just in customer interactions but for other 
business functions, such as supply chain management, workforce management, product development and marketing.

However, for this vision to be realised, execution is paramount. Consumers must be allowed to opt-in to 
biometric technology and understand the value it delivers for them. IT integration and usability testing must 
be rigorous, with customer experience foremost in mind.

While best practices are emerging, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Companies need to evaluate their 
current processes and decide which steps will lead them to this digital future. For example, biometric 
payments could be a first step, or facial recognition combined with data integration. Whatever the starting 
point, retailers can take advantage of the digital strategies and investments they’ve already made in the quest 
for an omnichannel approach.

Today’s technology advances offers innovative retailers the chance to transition from disrupted to be a disruptors.
